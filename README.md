# 42_Cpp_Module_07

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 07** introduces the learner to the concept of C++ templates, in particular - function templates, class templates, default types in templates and specialization.

## Description

ex00:  
Implement three function templates ('swap', 'min', 'max'), which can be called with any type, as long as the types of both arguments are the same and they support all comparison operators.  
(first intro to function templates)

ex01:  
Write a function template 'iter', which takes in the address of an array (any type of array must work), the length of the array and a function to be called on all elements of the array. The third parameter can be an instantiated function template.  
(a more extensive function template & using instance of a function template in another template)

ex02:  
Develope a class template 'Array', containing elements of type T. Write multiple constructors, creating an array and allocating memory. Oveload subscript operator [].  
(first look into class templates)

## Learnings

A good, albeit quick refresher for my knowledge about function and class templates in C++.
And through the 42 videos and examples, a deeper view into parametric macros in C, including their pros and cons.
